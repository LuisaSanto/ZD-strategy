## Description
The assignment is to explore the characterization of complex networks in line with what was discussed and seen in both theoretical and lab lessons.

We chose to use Python3 and networkX to create various graphs based on different generation models and compare them.

### Models considered
- Barabasi Albert
- Watts Strogratz
- Node Duplication

### Studied Metrics
- Degree Distribution
- Average Degree
- Average Path Length
- Clustering Coeficient


## Usage
	cd src/
	python3 main.py
(the program has a guided shell but it is possible to use flags for faster access. use -h for help)
